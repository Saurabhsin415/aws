<p> Sattamatka gambling or satta is a form of betting and lottery which originally involved betting on the opening and closing rates of cotton 
transmitted from the New York Cotton Exchange to the Bombay Cotton Exchange. It originates from before the era of Indian independence 
when it was known as Ankada Jugar("figures gambling").In the 1960s, the system was replaced with other ways of generating random numbers,
including pulling slips from a large earthenware pot known as a matka,or dealing with playing cards.</p>

<p>Matka gambling is illegal in India.As per the Public Gambling Act, 1867 both betting establishments and satta matka houses were outlawed completely.
Whoever is caught playing the game will be punished.</p>

<h3 className="m-0 p-0">How to play</h3>
<p className="p-0">To play, a gambler chooses three numbers between 0 and 9. The three chosen numbers are added together and the second digit of this resulting
number is noted down alongside the original three chosen numbers. This leaves the gambler with four numbers, from which point they may bet on
the various likelihoods of the numbers or number sequences appearing or being chosen from the pot.</p>
