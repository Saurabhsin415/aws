<p>Ratan Khatri, known as the original Matka King, from the early 1960s to mid-1990s controlled a nationwide illegal gambling network with international
connections which involved several lakh punters and dealt with crores of rupees.

Khatri`s matka syndicate started in the bustling business area of Dhanji Street in Mumbadevi where idlers used to wager on the daily trickle of
the fluctuating cotton rates from the New York market. Gradually, it became a big gambling hub as the quantum of bets and betters increased. 
Due to a row over a winning number plus the New York market`s five-day week schedule, compulsive betters began looking for alternatives. 
Based on the requests of his friends, Khatri started his own syndicate and started drawing three cards to decide the day`s number. 
Khatri used to draw three cards, twice daily at 9.00pm (the `open`) and at midnight (the `close`). The value of the open and close cards 
would be totalled to arrive at a winning number. The numbers would be relayed all across the betting hubs in the country and overseas. 
For a 25 paise bet the returns were at least Rs. 2.25 or more. Khatri`s betting was considered more genuine as the cards were reportedly opened
in the presence of patrons. During the emergency in India, Khatri was jailed and served 19 months behind bars. In the early 1990s, he retired 
from the gambling business and was living near Tardeo; however, he still continued to visit the Mahalaxmi Racecourse to bet on his favourite horses.
He died on May 9, 2020</p>
